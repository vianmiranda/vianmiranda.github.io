                <h1>&#x1f44b; Hello there, I am Vian!</h1> 
                
                <p>I'm currently a student at Rutgers University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics.</p>

                <p>This past summer, I was a Software Engineer Intern at Capital One, where I worked on a Kubernetes operator to improve security by identifying vulnerabilities within clusters.</p>

                <p>Previously, I was an undergraduate researcher at the Shumyatsky Lab through Rutgers' Aresty Research Center, where I developed an automated scoring system, leveraging pose estimation, to identify social interactions in mice.</p>

                <p>At Rutgers, I'm currently the Founder and President of the Rutgers' Organization of Cloud Computing (ROCC), focusing on hands-on projects and workshops with cloud technologies.</p>

                <p>If you'd like to read more about my projects, check out my GitHub. Also, feel free to connect with me at vian.miranda[at]rutgers.edu or on LinkedIn at linkedin.com/in/vianmiranda.</p>
