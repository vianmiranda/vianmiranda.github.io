                <p>I'm currently a student at Rutgers University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics.</p> 
                
                <p>This past summer, I was a Software Engineer Intern at Capital One, where I worked on a Kubernetes operator to improve security by identifying vulnerabilities within clusters.</p> 
                
                <p>Previously, I was an undergraduate researcher at the <a href="https://sites.rutgers.edu/shumyatsky-lab/">Shumyatsky Lab</a> through <a href="https://aresty.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers' Aresty Research Center</a>, where I developed an automated scoring system, leveraging pose estimation, to identify social interactions in mice.</p> 
                
                <p>At Rutgers, I'm currently the Founder and President of the <a href="https://rocc.site/">Rutgers' Organization of Cloud Computing (ROCC)</a>, focusing on hands-on projects and workshops with cloud technologies.</p>
